A safe and ergonomic entry-point for playdate games using [playdate-sys](https://docs.rs/playdate-sys).


## Maintenance status

I made this project for my personal use. I'll be happy if it can be useful to anyone else, but there are a few things to keep in mind:
* I only write documentation for my "future self", which may not be enough for people who are not in my head.
* The project may never be "feature complete" as I only add new features when I need them.

That being said, I also welcome suggestions and contributions.


## Alternatives

The [playdate] project is the best place to get started with playdate development in Rust.

Note, that `crankit-game-loop` is, in fact, compatible with the [playdate] crates, so you don't have to choose one over the other but can use them all together!
